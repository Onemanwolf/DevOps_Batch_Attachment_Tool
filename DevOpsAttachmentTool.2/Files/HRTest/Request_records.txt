Hi Mayra,

Please see email below.  Gale just called me to advise that this request may have come from Sara since the payroll team was left with some manual work after the implementation of the automation of non-CCL Casino payroll.  

She stated that Casino’s objective to get non-CCL casino population on Brightwell has been achieved so there are no additional asks from the Casino side. 

She also mentioned that just recently two additional enhancements were implemented to pay Filipino POEA and the collection of Filipino taxes which is why she thinks Sara is still asking for improvements to the process.  

Regards,
Sarah

Hi Gale,

I’ve been tasked with following up on an enhancement request that was submitted last year (2/25/19) for Casino Payroll.  Unfortunately, as you can see from the screenshot below there was no description provided with this request.  I’m reaching out to you because your name is listed as the User Contact.  Please let me know if you’re the person that can provide some information on the improvements that are being requested or let me know who I should speak to about this.  Thanks! Sarah

Good day!

I believe the testing that you were performing is already competed. Can we proceed with the database security assessment for FunPay/Lawson. I have already finished the security assessment of the front-end web application. I will share the consolidated report once the database assessment is done.

Danny: Kindly share your desk location.

Subject: RE: SQL Server Modernization 2019 - JECT DB Upgrade


Danny,
    Just a suggestion for sometime in the future when things settle down – The New UAT environment that Abdul has introduced is Always ON which is similar to the new production environment.  

The versions of SQL Server for both UAT environments may be the same, but the new UAT environment more closely mimics the production environment in terms of configuration.   There can be a few situations where it may only be possible to reproduce an issue in an Always ON UAT environment.

So, I agree that we could move forward with all scheduled deployments for now using the current UAT environment for (CrewStats, JECT, and TaxDb1099).

However, perhaps towards the end of this year, I encourage you to migrate your UAT environments to the new Always ON UAT environment – We will be better able to support and troubleshoot all possible Production issues then.

Best regards,

Robert Bullen

Hi Abdul,

We have 3 apps (CrewStats, JECT and TaxDB1099) that were already deployed and tested on CCLUATSHRDDB1\UATSQL3 and we intend to keep them there..

Moving forward, any new app that needs to be modernized will be migrated to the new UAT you provided below.

All 3 apps are planned to be deployed to PROD on CCLPRDSHRD2L1,3655.

Let me know if you have any questions.

Thanks.

HI Zafar,

As listed below, these are the new UAT and PROD SQL2016 Clustered shared servers, which will be shared by other applications for their dbs as well: 

	NEW OPCON Servers	NEW DB Servers
UAT	CCLUATSHD2OPCN1	CCLUATSHRD2L1,3655: 
CCLUATSHRD2DB1, CCLUATSHRD2DB2, CCLUATSHRD2D3
PROD	CCLPRDSHD2OPCN1	CCLPRDSHRD2L1,3655: 
CCLPRDSHRD2DB1, CCLPRDSHRD2DB2, CCLPRDSHRD2D3

Since you have tested the App with CCLUATSHRDDB1\UATSQL3 and the CCLUATSHRD2L1,3655 is also at the same version, you should be good to go to PROD directly.

But if you want to test it out once in the new UAT Env, that will be great and UAT and PROD will be in synch in respect to Env.
I will setup the JECT_CT_ORA Linked server and copy the DB over to the new UAT Listener CCLUATSHRD2L1,3655.

 << OLE Object: Picture (Device Independent Bitmap) >> 

Let me know.

Thanks,
Abdul K Mohammed

Findings:                            Network’s team network architect Daniel Ma was contacted to assist on the issue and he found that there was a migration on firewall settings two days ago, as NetChef traffic rules were not clear (considered ‘weak rules’) they proceeded by allowing CTX’s inbound traffic into the application but not outbound traffic. They manually updated firewall settings for allowing mentioned connection to be available for the application and CTX support team confirmed that orders started to get replicated on their database, allowing vendors to receive them. Janet also checked with some vendors and they confirmed the order were visible at their end.
Resolution:                        Updating outbound traffic firewall rules for the application.

CT counter app installed on an apple device, needs to have wifi data communication with the ship's Net Chef server.

Background:
Provide a description of the business problem:
Currently, the Bar Operations department, conducts weekly inventories on board. All the bar items are counted in each bar location on board. The counts are currently recorded on paper by the bartenders and then they are entered manually in the Crunch Time (CT) Inventory system, by the on board Finance Specialists. This process is old and inefficient. Therefore the implementation of an improved methodology needs to be done.
Action taken previously to solve the issue:
We tried to have the Crunch Time system installed on a Windows Tablet and have the Bartenders do inventories directly using the tablet. However the usability of the Crunch Time system on a tablet is not very efficient. Instead we would like to use the CT Counter mobile application.

Objectives:
Provide a concise description of the expected final project results in terms of business outcomes:
We want to leverage the functionality of the CT Counter app (installed on apple devices) to record inventory counts.
We need to develop a network architecture design, that will allow the CT Counter app to communicate wirelessly with the Net Chef server installed on each ship.
The data needs to flow from/to the CT Counter app to the Net Chef server."

The business case – we have an employee who did not meet the retirement rules.  However the executive committee has granted this employee an exception and wants to treat them as a retiree.  Benefits does not want to track them under the status 49 since they are concerned that if a few years from now, we reconcile the retiree’s based on the rules, the employee’s status will be moved back to non-retiree status.

SHORESIDE - current:
- EM CLIENT (Crunch Time desktop application) v05.20.00.09
- EM WEB (limited functionality)
- NET CHEF (limited functionality)
- CTX (CRUNCH TIME EXCHANGE)

SHIPBOARD - current:
- EM CLIENT (Crunch Time desktop application) v05.20.00.09
- NET CHEF (limited functionality)

With this upcoming upgrade, the following structure will be available:

SHORESIDE - software to be upgraded to:
- EM CLIENT (Crunch Time desktop application) v05.20.00.09 - REMAINS AS IT IS (NO UPGRADE)
- EM WEB - will be upgraded to the full functionality version
- NET CHEF - will be upgraded to the full functionality version
- CTX (CRUNCH TIME EXCHANGE) - REMAINS AS IT IS (NO UPGRADE)

SHIPBOARD - current:
- EM CLIENT (Crunch Time desktop application) v05.20.00.09 - REMAINS AS IT IS (NO UPGRADE)
- NET CHEF - will be upgraded to the full functionality version

PRE-REQUISITES for the upgrade:
- Crunch time needs to deliver the latest versions of EM WEB and NETCHEF (estimated delivery date is now DECEMBER 2018)
- Oracle DB12c needs to be installed at CCL in all locations (shore side and all 26 ships)

SERVERS/HARDWARE: there are existing servers/databases for all the applications. We just need to upgrade the software versions. There is no need of new server/databases installations.

ESTIMATED START DATE: 2019 (month TBD)

EM CLIENT (Crunch Time desktop application) will still need to remain with its current setup - as replication and some reports will still be handled through it.

GFT (general functionality testing) will have to include besides the regular end to end UAT:
- shore side groups testing (CT administration, purchasing, fleet finance, cost analytics, accounting, DWH, Tableau, Hyperion) 
- ship board groups testing (all crunch time related processes, replication and POS-CT depletion)
- applications and interfaces: Receipt interface to Oracle, PO interface to Oracle, CT-Mapper interface, CT-Eseacare interface, JECT)

ASSUMPTIONS:

CT COUNTER application (soon to be introduced) - will not be upgraded, but will be considered for GFT (general functionality testing)

CDP (Crunch Time data pump) - will not be upgraded, but will be considered for GFT (general functionality testing)"

The DBAs would have to agree with Apps Dev team on a downtime, for the environments modified (starting with Dev, then Test, UAT etc.) , to set the parameter REMOTE_OS_AUTHENT to  FALSE (currently TRUE and requires downtime to switch).
Then the DBAs would set the Kerberos configuration, the Oracle SQLNET configuration and change the DB individual accounts to Globally authenticated using their LDAP IDs.
The Apps Dev team and DBAs would have to try their account and confirm that they can connect
Then move to the next environment…

Negative testing would be needed, like disable a test LDAP account and verify that the associated DB account is also disabled.
We would need to work on the DBA and DML accounts with the PAM Service accounts and test that.
